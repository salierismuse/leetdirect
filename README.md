# leetdirect

basic firefox browser extension that allows you set websites that will redirect you automatically to a leetcode easy. if you have time to doomscroll, you've got five minutes for an easy!

quick breakdown:
  get_leetcode_easy.py: python script that fetches all easys from leetcode's website and provides the links. dumps into a txt file. this can obviously be modified to match whatever specifications you may want it to have if you'd like to change it. 

  getArray.py: converts the new links placed in problems.txt and turns them into a js array
